# LIRI


A basic CLI app that takes user input from the command line to carry out API calls on command.

To use the app simply enter one of these four commands:

-"concert-this":
This command will take your input and initialize a Bandsintown API call to give you upcoming concert information about the artist you searched
  

-"spotify-this-song": This command initializes a Spotify API call and returns artists, url's to the song, and album names. 

-"movie-this": This command returns information about the movie you entered using the OMDb API

-"do-what-it-says": This command runs a Spotify API call for the song "I Want it That Way".
